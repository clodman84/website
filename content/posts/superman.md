A bird, a plane, an intercontinental ballistic missile, they all have one thing in common, they need to know where they are (or aren't). But Superman doesn't have pockets to keep his phone while flying across thousands of kilometres with the precision of a wandering albatross. How could he possibly know where he's going?

# Kelly watch the stars 

How exactly do you describe your position? We rather instinctively rely on describing our position relative to objects that the person we're trying to communicate with knows about. "On my bed", "in Bangalore", "outside the warden's chamber", etc. The more stationary and universally recognised the landmark of choice, the more meaningful our description of position.

But what if there is nothing stationary around you, what if everywhere you looked, was practically the same. What do you use to orient yourself? You look a little harder of course. This is something our seafaring species has spent millenia perfecting.

Birds seem to know where they're headed, so we just tagged along behind them. Navigators seeking land sail opposite the birds' path in the morning (they're flying away from land) and with them at night (clearly they are going to land somewhere), especially relying on large groups of birds, and keeping in mind changes during nesting season. Some cultures like the Polynesian navigators used [songs](https://youtu.be/ShbODIG2C60?si=E8LyRXPW1eeJGuAy) and mythological stories as mnemonics to remember what to do. 

But there is something that is uniquely universal when it comes to navigation. Our reliance on stars. Stars are so unfathomably far away, that for all practical purposes they are about as stationary and universally recognised as it gets. Although stars hold fixed celestial positions year round, their rising time changes with the seasons. You can set your heading to a specific star at the horizon and shift to a different star when it rose too high. You could then memorise the order of stars to follow and build a route. Of course to figure out which star you are looking at, you could draw patterns and shapes in the sky and give them names and insert them into stories to remember what to do.

The zodiac signs divide the apparent path of the sun (called the ecliptic shown in red) into 12 parts. You can tell what month it is by looking at what zodiac sign the sun is inside during sunset. Now you know how to keep track of how many years it's been since the apocalypse.

The 4500 year old history of the Zodiac system and all its different dialects deserves an article of it's own, instead, I'll focus on something else.

A "ballistic" body is something that is guided purely during a brief initial phase of flight, with the subsequent trajectory subject to the whims of air resistance and gravity. Making things go ballistic has always been a staple of our species. We're unnaturally efficient at turning the act of hurling objects into forms of entertainment, sustenance and warfare. It's really no wonder that the computer itself was a byproduct of us trying to figure out where the things we're flinging inevitably succumbs to the omnipresent shackle of the Earth's gravity. The kind of computation the Hulk would have to do before he just jumps really hard and lands exactly where he intends to. 

The ENIAC, the first programmable computer, was originally designed to calculate artillery firing tables. Pretty soon the ENIAC shifted it's focus to simulating the randomness of nuclear decay, something that makes a lot of sense when you realise that the ENIAC was built in 1945, a rather explosive time to be alive. The Monte-Carlo method of throwing random numbers at a problem was probably the first algorithm ever run on a general purpose computer.

The ENIAC was the beginning of the rapidly shrinking size of computing machines, and was retired after 70000 hours of use. Later iterations like the EDVAC and ORDVAC worked in binary unlike the ENIAC which was still built around the biological and cultural simplicity of base 10. Development on both of them continued in the Ballistic Research Laboratory.

Apart from ENIAC's six primary programmers, Kay McNulty, Betty Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas and Ruth Lichterman, one of the people who oversaw the development of the ENIAC was John von Neumann. A name that pops up in so many different seemingly unrelated places, that one could be forgiven for assuming that they were different people. Merely listing out his contributions would make even the most accomplished reader feel like their life has amounted to nothing. Here's just a brief snippet of the things he's done:

* [The Mathematical Framework of Quantum Physics](https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1958-64-03/S0002-9904-1958-10206-2/S0002-9904-1958-10206-2.pdf)
* [Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)
* [Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)
* [Self-Replication (before we discovered DNA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_universal_constructor)

The ridiculous thing about Jon von Neumann was that he wasn't alone. You see John was a part of a very exclusive club of prominent scientists that had all emigrated from Budapest. Many of them, including John von Neumann, Eugene Wigner, Leo Szilard, Edward Teller, and Theodore von Kármán, were friends since high school, studied similar subjects, and even attended some of the same universities in Germany. Each one of them was so extraordinarily brilliant that they must have come from another planet, and were called "The Martians". Edward Teller in particular was rather fond of his monogram (E.T).

Speaking of Mars, how do we get there?

# TODO:
- explain the complexity of orbits
- why superman doesn't need orbits
- why navigation is still hard
- voyager 1
- how von neumann and superman are immigrants, polynesian settlers had no idea where they were going, and voyager 2 has no destination.

You don't always have to know where you're going, only what you're leaving behind.
