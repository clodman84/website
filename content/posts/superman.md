A bird, a plane, a cruise missile, they all have one thing in common, they need to know where they are (or aren't). But Superman doesn't have pockets to keep his phone in, how could he possibly know where he's going?

# Moon Safari #4

Before you can go somewhere, you need to figure out where you are. We instinctively rely on describing our position relative to objects that the person we're trying to communicate with knows about. "On my bed", "outside the warden's chamber", "under the Eiffel Tower" etc. The more stationary and universally recognised the landmark of choice, the more meaningful our description of position.

But what if there is nothing stationary around you, what if everywhere you looked, was practically the same. What do you use to orient yourself? You look a little harder of course, after all this is something our seafaring species has spent millenia perfecting.

Birds seem to know where they're headed, so we just tagged along behind them. Navigators seeking land sail opposite the birds' path in the morning and with them at night (birds need to rest), especially relying on large groups of birds, and keeping in mind changes during nesting season. Some cultures like the Polynesian navigators used [songs](https://youtu.be/ShbODIG2C60?si=E8LyRXPW1eeJGuAy) and mythological stories as mnemonics to remember what to do. But staying in the splash zone under a flock of well-fed seagulls wouldn't make for a pleasant cruise, we can do better. 

Stars are so unfathomably far away, that for all practical purposes they are about as stationary and universally recognised as it gets. Although stars hold fixed celestial positions year round, their rising time changes with the seasons. You can set your heading to a specific star at the horizon and shift to a different star when it rose too high. You could then memorise the order of stars to follow and build a route. Of course to figure out which star you are looking at, you could draw patterns and shapes in the sky and give them names and insert them into stories to remember what to do.

So lets say Superman can navigate by using the stars as reference points, after all he can't just see where he's headed, the curvature of the Earth would get in the way. Even then he would be pretty useless without one of these:

On first glance a sextant looks like the bastard child of a vernier caliper and a telescope, and to be fair, it kind of is. The only thing a sextant does is measure the angle something in the sky makes with the horizon. It can also be used to measure the angle between two objects in the sky.

{{< figure src="/images/using_sextant.gif" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="This animation on how to use a sextant was Wikipedia's picture of the day for August 30, 2007">}}

This measurement is pretty useless on it's own but with a star chart and time of day, you can do some pretty neat things. If you sight the sun at noon, or the North Star at night, you can estimate your latitude. If you know the height of a landmark, (for instance a lighthouse), the angle and some quick trigonometry could tell you how far away from it you were. 

You can also figure out your longitude by measuring the angle between the moon and other celestial objects. If you're interested [the history of the longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_longitude) on Wikipedia is a great read. Something I'm glossing over right now is to perform these calculations, you need to know the time of day. 

So if Superman was really using the stars to navigate, he would need to fly around with a sextant, a g-shock, and a shelf full of maps and charts.

{{< figure src="/images/ENIAC.webp" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Gloria Ruth Gordon and Ester Gerston, early ENIAC programmers in front of a patch bay">}}

A "ballistic" body is something that is guided purely during a brief initial phase of flight, with the subsequent trajectory subject to the whims of air resistance and gravity. Making things go ballistic has always been a staple of our species. We're unnaturally efficient at turning the act of hurling objects into forms of entertainment, sustenance and warfare. It's really no wonder that the computer itself was a byproduct of us trying to figure out where the things we're flinging inevitably succumbs to the omnipresent shackle of the Earth's gravity. The kind of computation the Hulk would have to do before he just jumps really hard and lands exactly where he intends to. 

The ENIAC, the first programmable computer, was originally designed to calculate artillery firing tables. Pretty soon the ENIAC shifted it's focus to simulating the randomness of nuclear decay, something that makes a lot of sense when you realise that the ENIAC was built in 1945, a rather explosive time to be alive. It's helpful to remember that the aeronautical sextant was invented just 23 years before this. If Superman wants to go anywhere, he needs a computer.

The ENIAC was the beginning of the rapidly shrinking size of computing machines, and was retired after 70000 hours of use. Later iterations like the EDVAC and ORDVAC worked in binary unlike the ENIAC which was still built around the biological and cultural simplicity of base 10. Development on both of them continued in the Ballistic Research Laboratory.

Apart from ENIAC's six primary programmers, Kay McNulty, Betty Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas and Ruth Lichterman, one of the people who oversaw the development of the ENIAC was John von Neumann. A name that pops up in so many different seemingly unrelated places, that one could be forgiven for assuming that they were different people. Merely listing out his contributions would make anyone feel like their life is heading nowhere.

{{< figure src="/images/martian.webp" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Here's his Los Alomos ID badge">}}

The ridiculous thing about Jon von Neumann was that he wasn't alone. You see John was a part of a very exclusive club of prominent scientists that had all emigrated from Budapest. Many of them, including John von Neumann, Eugene Wigner, Leo Szilard, Edward Teller, and Theodore von Kármán, were friends since high school, studied similar subjects, and even attended some of the same universities in Germany. Each one of them was so extraordinarily brilliant that their peers hypothesised they must have come from another planet, and were known as "The Martians". Edward Teller in particular was rather fond of his monogram (E.T).

Speaking of Mars, how do we get there?

It was Newton's prediction of the motion of the moon (not an apple) that proved his equation of gravity. An entire army of astronomers including Newton himself continued working in the fledgeling field of orbital mechanics. All of this was partly in an effort to predict the Moon's position to two arc-minutes which would result in a 1° error in measuring the longitude on Earth. 

If Superman's flight is like climbing an invisible ladder, then he doesn't have to bother with the complexity of orbits. But that would also mean that early navigation systems like the Soviet "Globus" INK which was an almost entirely mechanical contraption would be useless for Superman. It could pinpoint the location of a spacecraft above the Earth, and with the flip of a switch show the landing site if the spacecraft continued along it's trajectory. But at the end of the day, it's cogs and gears were designed to obey the rules of orbital motion, it didn't actually *know* where it was (whatever that means). Of course, everything **else** is obeying these rules, Superman has to fly to where something is going to be, and not where it is.

Gary Flandro, in 1964 noticed a particularly unique alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune would occur in the late 70s. The kind of alignment than happens once every 175 years. You see, this alignment would allow a single spacecraft to visit all the outer planets using gravity assists. At the height of the space race (which America was losing rather spectacularly at the time), the goalpost needed to be shifted. JPL came up with something they called "The Grand Tour", a squad of 4 probes that would visit all the outer planets. The project was later scaled down and on August 20th, 1977 Voyager 2 took of on a Titan IIIE rocket and Voyager 1 took off 16 days later.

Both of which will remain the only interstellar spacecraft we have ever made for a few decades at the very least.


You don't always have to know where you're going, only what you're leaving behind.
