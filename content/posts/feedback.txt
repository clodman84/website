This is a fascinating piece that captures the Vsauce-style meandering beautifully! The Superman hook is clever and your journey through navigation history is genuinely engaging. Here's my critique:

## What's Working Really Well

**The structure is solid.** Your progression from Superman → celestial navigation → early computers → orbital mechanics creates a satisfying intellectual journey. The transitions feel natural rather than forced.

**Your historical storytelling shines.** The "Martians" section is particularly compelling - that detail about them being high school friends who all became legendary scientists is the kind of surprising connection that makes readers go "whoa." The ENIAC programmers and the shrinking computer boards photo work great too.

**The tone hits the sweet spot.** You're explaining complex concepts without being condescending, and your voice comes through clearly. The Gary Flandro gravity assist explanation is especially well done.

## Areas for Improvement

**The Superman framing needs more payoff.** Right now, Superman disappears after the opening and only briefly returns in the orbital mechanics section. Either weave him throughout more consistently or find a stronger way to circle back to him in your conclusion. The reader expects resolution on "how does Superman navigate?"

**Some transitions could be smoother.** The jump from sextants to ENIAC works conceptually but feels abrupt. Maybe add a sentence bridging the navigation calculation complexity to the need for computing power.

**Technical density varies unevenly.** The sextant section gets quite detailed (which is good!), but then you breeze through orbital mechanics concepts that might need more explanation for accessibility. Consider your audience's baseline knowledge.

## Specific Suggestions

**Strengthen the ending.** That final line is poetic, but your conclusion needs to tie back to Superman more directly. Maybe something about how Superman, unlike us mere mortals, doesn't need to know where he's going because he can see through the Earth's curvature? Or how his navigation is pure intuition while we need centuries of accumulated knowledge?

**Consider adding one more "wow" moment.** You have several (the Martians, Voyager's grand tour), but one more surprising connection could elevate it further. Maybe something about how GPS satellites have to account for relativity?

**The pacing in the middle section could tighten up.** The ENIAC history is great but runs a bit long compared to other sections.

## Overall Assessment

This has real potential to be a standout piece. Your research is solid, your examples are vivid, and you clearly understand how to make complex topics accessible. The Vsauce influence works in your favor - you're not just copying the format but adapting it to your own voice and interests.

The biggest opportunity is strengthening that Superman throughline and making sure every reader who came for "how does Superman navigate?" leaves satisfied, even after this delightful journey through human navigation history.

Keep the Spotify embed - it's a nice touch that adds personality to the piece.
